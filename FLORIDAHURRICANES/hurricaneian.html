<h2> Hurricane Ian</h2>
<p>Ian weakened only slightly as it crossed Cuba, then strengthened into a monstrous category 4 storm before making its second landfall just south of Punta Gorda, FL on September 28. 
A catastrophic storm surge struck the west coast of Florida south of Tampa, and over 20 inches of rain caused major flooding across the peninsula all the way to the Atlantic coast.  
Ian spent many hours slowly crossing Florida and emerged off the east coast as a tropical storm with winds around 65 mph during the late morning hours of September 29. </p>

<h2> Storm History </h2>
<p> Tropical Storm Ian formed late on September 23, but only slowly strengthened over the following few days as the storm had a tilted vertical structure. 
 By September 26, Ian attained hurricane strength while located a little over 300 miles south of Cuba. 
 Ian strengthened rapidly prior to striking western Cuba early in the morning of September 27 as a category 3 hurricane with winds as high as 125 mph.</p>
 <h2> Damages & Facts </h2>
 <ul>
<li> Hurricane Ian is the second-deadliest storm to strike the continental U.S. this century, behind Hurricane Katrina in 2005. </li>
<li>At least 101 people have been confirmed dead, including 92 in Florida, five in North Carolina, one in Virginia, and three in Cuba.</li>
<li> Ian strengthened to a Category 4 storm as it made landfall west of Fort Myers, Florida, on September 28, 2022.</li>
<li>Hurricane Ian followed Hurricane Fiona, a Category 1 storm that made landfall in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 18, 2022.</li>
